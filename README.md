# odin-rock-paper-scissors

This was the first JS project, and the goal was to create a paper scissors rock game that was played in the console.

It was fairly straightforward, and was a good way to practice recently learned JS syntax. It was also a chance to practice setting up a new github repo and committing periodically. I'm still not confident I'm writing good git commit messages, although am happy with the size/frequency of commits.

One of the things that didn't feel right during this project was needing to 'manually' type out different cases for each of the possible match results. There is probably a more programmatic way of doing it, but there's a good chance that would also be overengineering for a problem this size.

I was happy with the getComputerChoice function, it felt like there was no redundant code there.

I'm still not used to the lack of whitespace within functions that seems to be recommended. That's probably something I'll adjust to, or maybe I'm doing it wrong.
